# Counter App  

A simple React-based Counter App to understand state management and UI updates using the `useState` hook.  

Below is a screenshot of the Counter App, showcasing its simple and interactive UI for incrementing and decrementing the counter.

## Features  
- Increment and decrement the counter with responsive UI updates.  
- Clean and modern functional component design.  
- Demonstrates the use of React hooks for dynamic state handling.  

## Why I Built This  
This project is part of my journey to learn React. I focused on:  
1. Understanding how `useState` works for managing and updating state.  
2. Learning why hooks are crucial in React for functional components.  
3. Exploring how state changes propagate to update the UI dynamically.  

## Tech Stack  
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.  
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used in the app.  
- **CSS**: Basic styling for a clean look.  

## Getting Started  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/batoolarifa/Counter-App-React.git
   cd counter-app  
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

3. Start the app:  
   ```bash  
   npm start dev
   ```  

4. Open your browser and navigate to:  
   ```  
   http://localhost:3000  
   ```  

## Usage  
- Click the **Increment  Value** button to increment the counter.  
- Click the **"Decrement Value** button to decrement the counter.  

## What I Learned  
- How to use the `useState` hook to manage state in functional components.  
- The importance of hooks in modern React for clean and efficient code.  
- Propagating state changes to dynamically update the UI.
